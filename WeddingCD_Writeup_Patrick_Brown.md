## **Case**
Wedding Consign and Design is a small wedding consignment business. The goal of this project was to
help the owners better understand their data and provide insights for future business decisions.
Through this project, we introduced the owners to data analytics. We identified the major contributors
to sales and provided recommendations to increase future business and consignor revenue.

## **Design**
Wedding Consign and Design has been open for less than 5 years. It is a small business owned and
operated by two individuals. After discussing the possibilities provided by data science and analytics, we
decided to focus on two questions. 
  - How do different product categories compare to each other? 
  - How do markdowns fit with sales? 

With Data Analysis and visualization tools, we explore these questions and provide valuable insights to help the growing business.

## **Data**
The data set was an itemized historical inventory for the store. [This dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjHOZG_dSF5Dt3mSCV0c4Dun4tQvbCMS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117821230893380193723&rtpof=true&sd=true) consisted of 50,000 entries
of items each with information on item categories, entry and transfer dates, markdowns, price and
more. We used a variety of aggregations for different analyses such as product categories and purchase
date.

## **Tools**
- ConsignPro (Inventory Tracking System)
- Google Sheets
- Data Studio
- Tableau

## **Communication**
We held weekly meetings with the owners of the shop. We discussed progress and new
directions/questions as they arose. End results were organized into an [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrick.brown4037/viz/WeddingShop/Home) for the
clients and a slide presentation.
